# 🚨 URGENT: Add Real Signature Photo

## Signature looks BAD in receipt! Fix it NOW:

### **Step 1: Create Transparent PNG (2 Minutes)**

1. **Go to this website:** https://www.remove.bg
2. **Upload** the signature photo you gave me (white paper one)
3. **Download** the result - it will be transparent PNG
4. **Rename** it to: `signature.png`

### **Step 2: Put in Project**

Copy `signature.png` to:
```
frontend/
└── public/
    └── signature.png  ← Put here!
```

### **Step 3: I'll Update Code**

Once you put the file, tell me and I'll update the code to use it!

## OR - Quick Method (If you want me to do it):

Send me the signature photo again as a file attachment, I'll guide you through a simple crop tool!
